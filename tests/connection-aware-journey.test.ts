/*
  Basic Connection-Aware Journey Planning Test
  
  This test validates that the new journey timing engine can handle connection-based journeys
  and prevents impossible connections like the Bendigo → South Morang example that motivated
  this feature development.
  
  The test mocks PTV API responses to simulate a scenario where:
  1. No direct route exists between origin and destination
  2. Connection-aware planning finds a valid two-leg journey
  3. Connection time validation prevents impossible transfers

TODO for comprehensive testing:

1. Mock PTV API responses for the Bendigo → South Morang scenario:
   - No direct routes between origin and destination
   - V/Line departure from Bendigo at 1:26 PM
   - Arrival at Southern Cross at 3:45 PM (realistic 2+ hour journey)
   - Metro departures from Southern Cross starting at 3:57 PM (12+ minute connection)

2. Verify the system prevents impossible 8-minute connections by:
   - Calculating actual arrival time from stopping patterns
   - Applying connection policy rules (V/Line→Metro at Southern Cross = 12 minutes)
   - Only suggesting feasible connections

3. Test edge cases:
   - No feasible connections within search window
   - Missing stopping pattern data
   - Disrupted or cancelled services
   - Tight but feasible connections with warnings

This validates the core problem described in the user's example is solved.
